So How Did I Code My Assignment ?

Before i touched the comptuter i got a pen and a piece of paper .I made a rough design of what i wanted my game to look like and i wrote down what i wanted it to do 
(ie What Functionality it would have). I started by coding the Game engine and decideing what was going to be in my Game tick() and render() methods.Next i made the player class 
and decided on things like player color and movement speed.I then implemented player movement using WASD .Now that I had a moving player it was time to move onto the enemies.

next i set out making each enemy 
- A basic red enemy
- A Fast yellow enemy 
- A pink enemy that follows the players around 
- A boss that fires bullets at the players 

Once all my enemies had been created i made a spawner class to handle what enemies spawned each time the user progressed to a new level and i also made a menu system and a shop 
so the user cuold navigate around my game.
